Daily_2017_07-05,"Working fathers in East China's Jiangsu province can now take up to 30 days paid paternity leave to care for their newborns - double the amount of time in most other Chinese provinces. The Jiangsu government's legal office has drafted a local regulation to solicit public opinions on the change, which stipulates that new fathers can have 15 days paternity leave and an additional 15 days of ""joint parental leave"". It is designed to ""promote gender equality in employment"" and ""encourage husbands and wives to share the housework"", the government said. The move has been welcomed by parents and netizens alike. Zhong Lei, father of a 4-year-old girl from Nanjing, said he is now considering having a second child because of the change. ""It was a nightmare when my daughter was born, especially for my wife,"" he said. ""As a new mother, she needed help and I was not there for her. It will be great to have a month off work to take care of her and the newborn."" According to the Jiangsu Women's Federation, China does not have a nationwide regulation for paternity leave. Each province and municipality regulates their own paternity leave, which varies from 10 to 15 days. Huang Xinwei, a pregnancy and postpartum psychology specialist at Nanjing Maternity and Child Health Hospital, said a longer period of paternity leave benefits both wives and husbands. ""Learning how to take care of newborns helps to foster a good father-child relationship. It also helps the fathers to realize how difficult life can be for new mothers,"" he said. ""Many new mothers have postpartum depression to some degree. It is important for them to be accompanied by family members, especially by the husbands. The sooner fathers take a part in raising their children, the better."" Meng Xiaosi, a Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National Committee and vice-president of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, said during this year's two sessions in March that many women choose not to have a second child due to lack of child care support and financial pressure. She called for longer paid paternity leave for both husbands and wives. However, concerns have been raised that more time off work may increase costs for enterprises and affect the careers of fathers taking leave. ""It's possible that I may be transferred from my current post to a less important one,"" said Zhong, the father. ""I would not be surprised if private companies place more emphasis on job applicants' marital status after this change. The government should take more responsibility, including giving subsidies to companies."" ",5-Jul-17,2017,Daily
Daily_2021_03-10,"CPPCC member Chen Xia appeals for greater childcare support and deeper thought in education, Li Yingxue reports. The government should extend parental leave and share the cost with companies or employers to help stimulate improvement in the country's birthrate through greater support, a policy adviser says. Chen Xia, a member of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, spoke about the birthrate and other issues she expects to be discussed at the two sessions, the annual meetings of China's top legislature and political advisory body. ""A generation or a nation, if it wants to have a proper replacement of its members, the total fertility rate should be 2.1, but we are less than that,"" she says, adding that she is concerned with the low birthrate that will lead to an aging population. In her proposal at the two sessions, Chen writes: ""First, let's extend the leave when a couple has a baby. Mainly, we only ask for the mother to get maternity leave, but I also suggest that we have a law which allows the father to take paternity leave."" Chen says for a child to grow with a healthy personality, both parents should have enough time with the baby, so the parental leave is needed. Currently, maternity leave can be taken for at least 98 days. However, this method will increase cost for companies or employers, so Chen suggests cost-sharing between the government and such parties. ""It's not only a matter for the family, it's also an issue for the whole of society. A couple raises a child who will eventually contribute to society, therefore each of us should contribute to childbearing,"" she adds. Chen suggests spending some national revenue to cover the cost of better medical care for children, or extend compulsory education from nine years to 12 years. According to Chen, to prepare her proposal for the two sessions, she first listened to the voices in her field - from colleagues, friends, students and many others - to learn about their concerns and wishes. Then she did research, including reading published books and papers, and talked to experts before writing the proposal to explain why the issue is important and offering her suggestions. ""We are like a channel to communicate as the voice in our field. That voice will be heard during the two sessions, and society and the government will pay attention to the issues we highlight in our proposals,"" she says. In previous years, Chen proposed to enhance critical thinking in the education system and also gave suggestions on how to deal with China's aging society. In 2019, as a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Chen suggested national prizes for scholars in the humanities and social sciences, so that top specialists in the fields are recognized and more youngsters are inspired to pursue such studies. Promoting philosophy and the social sciences is included in the country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) that is expected to be ratified during this year's two sessions. The development of social sciences plays a significant role in the country's progress, Chen says. ""The development of technology and natural sciences can nourish our body, but we also need something to nourish our mind and spirituality,"" she says, adding that philosophy also trains people to think rationally. She says society needs the work of philosophers and social scientists, which also covers literature, history and arts. ""They provide inspiration and resources for us to reflect on our lives - to reflect on the way we have come and the way that will lead into the future. That's extremely important."" Chen says to promote social sciences and philosophy, the education system should be improved. ""We give the kids this kind of education, so we can spend more time on philosophy, logic, literature, history and the arts,"" she says. Specializing in traditional Chinese philosophy, Chen says it's important to inherit the wisdom of our ancestors. ""We should find a way to illustrate it, make it understandable, interesting and important for us today,"" she says. Chen says tradition is not something for the museum and, at the same time, people should have critical thinking about which parts of tradition should be brought into the modern world. ""Tradition is always changing, and tradition has a vitality to respond to what we are facing today,"" Chen says. Chen says traditional philosophical thinking can contribute to modern society in ways beyond the relationship between humans. Chen's study focuses on Taoism, and she says Taoism emphasizes the harmonious relationship between people and the environment. ""Urbanization, industrialization, commercialization - they all push us to consume too much. Taoism tells us to live a simple life,"" she says.",10-Mar-21,2021,Daily
Daily_2021_07-07,"More details needed on how third-child policy will protect rights, employment After China announced on May 31 that all couples will be allowed to have three children, up from two, working mothers and young women are still waiting for more details on how the policy will be implemented and how their rights will be protected. Many want to see the policy have a positive impact on correcting gender discrimination in workplaces before deciding to have another child. Experts said their concerns are reasonable, reflect the professional predicament faced by many women, and highlight the urgent need to step up implementation of fertility-friendly policies, such as promoting flexible working hours and improving legislation to tackle sex-based discrimination in employment. Global phenomenon Jia, a public relations manager in Shanghai who asked that her full name not be published, said that when she graduated from college in 2015, it was not uncommon to be asked in job interviews about whether she had a boyfriend, or whether she planned to get married or have children in the next few years. ""Of course I did not enjoy answering these inquiries because they had nothing to do with my qualifications and it felt like the company was not treating me as a competitive job candidate like they would treat a male counterpart,"" she said. After working in the advertising and marketing industry for nearly six years, she began to understand some companies' reservations about hiring young women. ""I'd encountered a few colleagues who had to abruptly leave their positions after becoming pregnant. Some have returned but the priority of their lives has obviously turned to taking care of kids,"" she said. ""I wonder if there is any solution to this dilemma. Is working and having children so irreconcilable? The answer is both yes and no, experts said. Li Na, a professor at China University of Labor Relations, said the negative impact of fertility on female workforce participation is a global phenomenon and rearing children is bound to chip away at time devoted to work. ""Some working mothers who initially planned to just take some time off to raise children ultimately found themselves becoming full-time mothers,"" Li said. ""The third-child policy will certainly add to the misgivings of employers, especially when it comes to giving promotions to or renewing labor contracts with female employees."" The female labor participation rate in China is above the global average. In 2019, about 61 percent of Chinese women aged 15 or above were working, compared with 54 percent for Japan, 57 percent for the United States and 56 percent for Germany, data from the World Bank shows. Biological burden Striking a balance between home and work has been tough for them, which is one of the top three reasons many families decided not to have more children after the universal second-child policy took effect in 2016, the National Health Commission said on June 1. Citing figures from a survey, the commission said: ""About 34.3 percent of women said their earnings were cut after childbirth. Among them, 42.9 percent had their salaries cut by at least half."" During an earlier interview with China News Service, Chang Kai, head of Renmin University of China's Labor Relations Research Center, said it is very difficult for many enterprises to get rid of gender discrimination in the current social environment, and the traditional view that women should be responsible for household chores still hampers their employment. ""But the main problem is that existing rules and regulations aimed at protecting the rights of female workers are not very strict, and their implementation is weak,"" he said. Chang said women have to bear the biological burden of taking maternity leave and breast-feeding, which will drive up enterprises' human resources costs. ""Governments are suggested to provide relevant subsidies to businesses, and step up social security and maternity insurance programs,"" he said. The coverage of maternity insurance has been rising in recent years. The National Healthcare Security Administration said recently that about 235 million people had enrolled in maternity insurance programs last year, up by 10 percent from 2019. Maternity insurance, paid for by employers and local governments, reimburses women who leave work to give birth. But, based on experiences in other countries, it's not enough to dispel employers' misgivings, Li said. ""A feasible solution adopted by Germany is to use funds from the national social security or medical insurance programs to make up the balance (of insurance premiums), instead of asking employers to shoulder the burden,"" she said. In addition to maternity leave, Li added, favorable policies such as paternity leave and parental leave, have not been embraced or enforced strongly enough. ""The rollout of paternity leave is meant to lessen discrimination against women, but it is not clear who will pay the salaries of male employees during their time off. As a result, both employers and employees are lukewarm about it,"" she said. Li said detailed regulations are also needed on how to implement parental leave, as the country is encouraging capable regions to launch trial programs. ""Parental leave usually lasts one to three years and can effectively solve the issue of rearing children before they are sent to kindergarten at 3 years old,"" she said. Innovative approaches Li said some key questions remain, including how payment should be arranged during such leave, how to prevent men from shifting all responsibilities for raising children to women and how to coordinate parents' eventual return to the job market and work. More can be done to address these issues, she said. Another promising approach is to promote flexible working schedules, Li said. ""If a husband and a wife can stagger their working hours, they can resolve the conflict between work and home,"" she said. Li Jia, deputy head of the aging society research center at Pangoal Institution, a Beijing-based public policy think tank, told China Business Journal that paternity leave is only a supplemental approach, and the core solution is to promote ""integration of work and home"", such as working from home. ""The shift also involves legal issues, such as how to draft contracts with homebound workers and how to protect the rights of both parties in this context,"" he added. A guideline released by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and eight other government departments in February 2019 banned any form of discrimination against women at work, including setting higher bars for or rejecting female candidates, and asking them to reveal their marital status or childbearing plans. Li Na, from China University of Labor Relations, said more forceful and detailed laws against gender discrimination at work should be established. ""Existing regulations are too general,"" she said. ""Gender discrimination can be very implicit, and we need stronger efforts and skills to detect it."" ",7-Jul-21,2021,Daily
Daily_2022_01-12,"BEIJING - The moment they are picked up from kindergarten each day, Tan Xinyan and her schoolmates scamper into a playground with newly installed swings, climbing frames and slides. Even the piercing winter cold and early nightfall in Beijing cannot change their daily routine. ""I'm surprised that such a small change can bring the children so much joy,"" says Tan's mother Hu Yufeng, referring to the new facilities in her residential community. The appearance in old neighborhoods of well-equipped children's playgrounds reflects steps China is taking to create more favorable conditions for child-rearing. The world's most populous country is bracing for the prospect of low fertility rates, which many countries, particularly the advanced economies, are experiencing. The latest census showed that the country's total fertility rate was at a low level of 1.3 in 2020. In 2015, China began to allow all couples to have a second child. In 2021, this was expanded to three children for each family. It was followed by a slew of supportive measures. The country's population and family planning law was also amended to foster a more birth-friendly society. ""Policy design and lawmaking at the top aim to address public concerns over the heavy burdens of bearing, raising and educating children,"" says Zhang Guilong, a senior official with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature. At local level, support on the way includes extended paternity leave, extra parental leave and enhanced public services in terms of tax cuts, housing, employment and education, among other areas. Having grown up as the only child in her family, the 35-year-old mother always envied those who had siblings to play with and offer support. However, she initially hesitated to have a second child, given that her parents and parents-in-law are already in their late 60s, and she and her husband both have busy careers. ""We would be irresponsible parents if we could not offer the children the attention and care they need for a happy and healthy childhood,"" Hu says. As it turns out, she found more happiness with two children. ""What doubled is not the workload, but the joy and good memories they created,"" Hu says. With supportive policies being implemented, more mothers-to-be aiming for two or three children are expected to feel the same way. In Beijing, women enjoy 30 days of extra maternity leave, and both parents will have five days of parental leave every year before their child turns 3. In Northeast China's Liaoning province, the paid parental leave for mothers and fathers will amount to 10 days, and new dads will enjoy 20 days of paternity leave. More regions are following suit. ""It is really good news for families like us, where both parents have full-time jobs,"" says Luo Hua, a 38-year-old mother from Yingkou in Liaoning, who is welcoming her third child. The country is also on the move to develop child care services and improve the affordability and availability of preschool education. Government funding for public child care services and support to the private sector in developing the services will increase during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25). As for preschool education, the authorities will increase the gross enrollment ratio in kindergartens to over 90 percent by 2025. The extensive network of health workers at the primary level, particularly in rural areas, has been used to spread prenatal and postnatal knowledge among young couples and offer guidance on parenting. In terms of future incentives for couples having children, experts at the Guangdong Academy of Population Development have suggested moves to ensure fair access to education, as well as increasing the supply of quality education resources and offering tax cuts and subsidies to families with more than one child. ""The core of optimizing family planning policy is unleashing child-rearing potential at the individual household level,"" says Song Jian, deputy head of the population development studies center at Renmin University of China. ""It requires concerted efforts across society and better social services to alleviate the burden of families in having and raising children."" For Hu Yufeng, the creation of a birth-friendly society requires more changes like new swings and slides. As her daughter Xinyan is to attend elementary school next September, Hu is expecting policies that extend further through her daughter's entire journey to adulthood. ""Ultimately, children are the creators of our future, and it's the job of us grown-ups to create an environment to enable this,"" she says.",12-Jan-22,2022,Daily
Daily_2022_03-04,"As China's demographic development is at a key juncture, a political adviser has called for concerted efforts to build a family-friendly society, including influencing family and childbearing values among the younger generation. Last year, the overall population on the Chinese mainland increased by just 480,000, down from 2.04 million in 2020 and the lowest in six decades, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. He Dan, a member of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said China's population has entered ""the zero-growth range"" - when the difference between births and deaths falls within 1 million, which ""marks a major shift of the main contradiction facing China's population development"". ""This means that China has completed the historic mission of curbing excessive population growth, and now it is confronted with the structural contradiction brought about by aging, low fertility and regional disparities in population development,"" she said during an exclusive interview ahead of this year's two sessions - the country's biggest annual political event. He, who is also the director of the China Population and Development Research Center, said although the decline in newborns is a natural result of socioeconomic development, it is vital to take action to prevent dramatic population fluctuations and reduce its impact on economic growth. A key move China made a key move in this regard in May by allowing all couples to have three children - up from two - and rolling out a number of supportive policies to encourage births. She said that when evaluating the impact of the policy adjustment, one should not only focus on the number of children born to each family, but also on efforts devoted to reduce the burden of childbearing, as well as raising and educating children, in addition to other measures aimed at helping families. So far, she said local governments have responded ""very actively"". ""Most of them have revised their provincial population and family planning regulations, and have drawn up new regulations for extending maternity, paternity and parental leave,"" she said. ""In addition, support for setting up the nursery service system has also been introduced in new regulations."" She noted that it will take some time to create a family-friendly environment throughout the whole of society. ""Rome was not built in a day. From the top-level design of the maternity security system to the implementation of specific policies and measures, there is still a lot of work to be done,"" she said. She added that it will be a challenge to reshape the family and childbearing values of the young population - a topic that she plans to focus on in her proposal to this year's two sessions. ""The rise in the number of people remaining single is seen as a threat to a society that is aging and has fewer births,"" she said. ""So we should start with influencing young people's attitudes toward marriage and childbearing."" Regarding concerns over gender discrimination at workplaces following the launch of extended paternity leave, she said that it is significant to keep gender equity promotion a high priority when devising supportive policies. She suggested that China either strengthens its maternity insurance programs or sets up a new maternity security fund to cover as many female workers as possible.

Daily_2023_06-13,"Last month, the China Family Planning Association announced the launch of a new round of pilot projects in 20 municipal-level regions to foster a ""new-era ""marriage and childbearing culture as part of efforts to create a fertility-friendly environment. The first batch of regional pilot projects was introduced in June last year. Wang Pei'an, deputy director of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's population, resources and environment committee and executive vice president of the association, explained the initiative during a question-and-answer session with China Daily. Q: How has China's marriage and childbirth culture changed over the years? A: Young Chinese are increasingly embracing the trend of delaying marriage and having children, and tend to have fewer children overall. Meanwhile, more people are opting to get divorced, never marry, or have no children. Childbearing is no longer seen as a ""must"". Among college students, a happy marriage and stable career are priorities when they consider having children, and they no longer feel ashamed about divorce. Compared with their parents' generation, their low desire to have children stems from personal choice. There are several reasons for these changes, including more years spent at school that delay marriage and plans to have children, and women's anxiety about balancing child-raising and advancing their careers. Many young people now attach greater importance to personal advancement and realizing self-worth. The cost of raising a child has also risen significantly, prompting complaints from families. The average size of households is shrinking - from 3.44 people per household in 2000 to 2.62 in 2020 - as trends such as DINK (double income no kids) become more prevalent. Q: When and why was the concept of a ""new-era"" marriage and childbearing culture raised? A: The concept has been proposed as China faces a low fertility rate, a rising aging population, and uneven cross- regional population growth. The number of children women of childbearing age plan to have is falling, and the nation's average fertility rate dropped from 2 in 1992 to 1.15 in 2021. However, in Chinese culture, families still play an irreplaceable and fundamental role in providing care for the elderly and children. They also offer emotional and economic support, as well as advancing production, community management and promoting civilization across society. This concept has been formulated to meet people's aspirations for better lives. The ""new-era"" marriage and childbearing culture focuses on promoting marriage and having children at proper ages, improving prenatal and postnatal care services, encouraging couples to share child-rearing responsibilities, and curbing the high costs of betrothal gifts and other outdated customs. Q: Many young adults equate marrying at the right age to losing career advancement opportunities. What do you think? A: From 2010 to 2020, the average age for a first marriage rose by 3.63 years for men and 3.95 years for women. Getting married and having children can divert women's time and energy and potentially affect their performance at work. The Chinese authorities have introduced new rules on parental leave, along with other supportive measures aimed at reducing the impact of marriage and child-raising on young people's careers and personal development. To help them strike a balance between having a family and their careers, it is important to foster societal recognition of the value of marrying and having children at proper ages. It is also important to build a system to spread child-raising costs across different sectors to prevent enterprises incurring economic losses due to hiring female employees, and to address young people's concerns. Q: Why is it important to promote gender equality and sharing the burden of raising children between couples? A: Gender inequality in families could exacerbate work-family conflicts among female workers. Facing pressure from work and family, many women who see bright career prospects are unwilling to have children. Promoting gender equality can enhance marital relationships and encourage women to have children. It is important to tap into the positive effects that gender equality can have on increasing fertility, and to make sharing the responsibilities of child care a consensus and custom observed by all of society. Q: What additional measures should be introduced to build a fertility-friendly environment? A: It takes time for supportive measures, such as tax deductions to offset the cost of raising a child, issuing fertility subsidies, and extending paternity and maternity leave, to produce results. More efforts are needed to step up supportive policies on tax and housing, promote equal access to high quality education resources, offer incentives for employers who guarantee employees reproductive rights, and strengthen support for nursery care service providers and manufacturers of related products. It is also important to improve nursery care services, upgrade maternity and paternity leave regulations, encourage the elderly to care for babies, guide young people in valuing the family, and advance the development of families. Q: What experience has been gained from implementing the initiative in the first batch of pilot regions? A: Authorities in these regions have launched awareness campaigns, such as making advocacy videos and posters, and getting volunteers, experts and different government departments to join efforts to strengthen publicity. Some regions have taken note of local groups' views. For example, the authorities in Lijiang, Yunnan province, have included objections from the Naxi ethnic group to high bride prices. Meanwhile, in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, parent-child activities have been organized and a large number of fathers have explained their role in sharing responsibilities. In Harbin, Heilongjiang province, group weddings have been held for newlyweds, who have been given brochures and related packages as part of measures to foster a new fashion of marriage.",13-Jun-23,2023,Daily
Daily_2024_01-18,"The makeover of a sculpture of a typical Chinese family at a park in Wuhan, Hubei province, soared to the top of microblogging platform Sina Weibo's trending list at the beginning of this year, generating 39 million views. Created in 2017 and titled A Better Future, the stainless-steel sculpture was repainted green. But what was more eye-catching was the addition of two children to the original family of three, creating a family of five. Guo Xue, the designer of the sculpture, told news outlet ThePaper.cn that he was asked by the park's management to update the sculpture to better reflect the beauty and happiness of family life in the new era. This family sculpture mirrors China's efforts in recent years to encourage births, improve the national demographic structure and tackle population aging. Despite numerous preferential policies rolled out across the country, the demographic curve continues a downward slide. On Wednesday, the National Bureau of Statistics said the total number of people in China fell for a second consecutive year in 2023, dropping by 2.08 million, or 0.15 percent, to 1.409 billion. It takes time for the incentives to change people's thoughts about having a baby later in life or not having one, experts said. Following the issue of China's third-child policy in 2021, local governments have formulated detailed and tailor- made policies to foster a better social environment for having and nurturing babies. In 2021, Panzhihua in Sichuan province proposed to give 500 yuan ($70) per month per child to local couples who have a second or third child until the children turn three years old, becoming the first Chinese city to allocate a parental allowance. To encourage multiple births, Hinggan League in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region has offered a differentiated childcare allowance, giving 2,000 yuan for the second child and 3,000 yuan for the third. In addition, the league has provided a 25-day paternity leave and prolonged the maternity leave period by an additional 30 days for mothers having a third child. Women now get 158 days maternity leave for their first or second child, and 188 for their third. Considering the surging infertility rate in China, some regions have included auxiliary reproductive means in health insurance. In July, Beijing added 16 therapeutic assisted reproductive services under its healthcare insurance system. The health department of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region started covering in vitro fertilization as well as other fertility services in November. The Gansu government also announced it would reimburse fertility treatments starting in February. ""China's negative population growth coincides with global trends in population declines and thus cannot be used to judge the quality of the national fertility supporting policies,"" said Yang Fan, a researcher at the Population Development Studies Center at Renmin University of China. Yang said that unlike some European countries and the United States, which have been experiencing a trend of later marriages and fewer childbirths for some time, China is only now entering that stage, and is inevitably showing a drop in the population. Over 56 percent of people aged 25 to 29 in China were single in 2022, up from 48.7 percent the previous year, according to the 2023 China Population and Employment Statistical Yearbook. The percentage is 20 percent for people aged 30 to 34. Guo Jiqiang, a professor at the School of Economics at Zhejiang University, said that the key to tackling population aging is enhancing people's willingness to give birth, especially the youth. ""China's second-child policy and third-child policy motivated more of those born in the 1970s to have children. Generation Z or so should be the backbone of fertility,"" said Guo, adding that apart from financial incentives, there should be more emotional guidance on the parent-offspring affection and raising children in preparation for senior life. The upcoming Year of the Dragon may be a silver lining or a shot in the arm for growth prospects as there is a traditional preference for babies born in the Year of the Dragon, Zhai Zhenwu, president of the China Population Association, told Time News, a news outlet in Guangdong province. Unlike the evil and cruel image associated with dragons in the West, dragons are widely considered auspicious in the East. ""We witnessed a small baby boom in 2012, the previous Year of the Dragon,"" he was quoted as saying. ""We expect the same this year.""

Daily_2024_04-09,"China will improve policies to boost birth rates by refining parental leave policies and increasing the supply of childcare services, according to the Government Work Report released during the two sessions that concluded last month. These steps will reduce the costs associated with giving birth and raising and educating children, it said. Many national legislators and political advisers made suggestions and proposals to build a fertility-friendly society during the sessions. Tan Lin, a deputy to the National People's Congress, said encouraging both men and women to share responsibility for childcare and other family duties will contribute to increasing women's willingness to bear children. The current incentive measures to guide enterprises into building a friendly environment for fertility and gender equality in employment are insufficient, said Tan, who is also the former vice-chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation. A survey conducted by the federation in 2022 covering 1,043 enterprises nationwide revealed that since the implementation of the three-child policy, 25.4 percent of the surveyed enterprises acknowledged situations where only men were recruited or given priority under equal conditions. Among the 930 surveyed enterprises with female employees who had given birth, 63.4 percent did not implement the policy of extending maternity leave. In addition, 82.4 percent of the enterprises hoped for subsidies on social insurance premiums during maternity leave, while 74.4 percent expected that the allowance for extended maternity leave would be paid from the basic medical insurance for employees. ""Traditional views regarding women as the primary caregivers in the family need to be changed,"" Tan said. The fourth Chinese Women's Social Status Survey, conducted in 2020, indicated that employed women spend an average of 154 minutes per day on household chores, approximately twice as many as men. Meanwhile, 76.1 percent of the daily care for children under age 17 was shouldered by mothers. Research shows that childbirth and childcare are the primary reasons for women's career interruptions, she said. Tan suggested improving the mechanism for the reasonable sharing of childbirth costs. ""We need to clarify that maternity leave awards and paternity leave allowances are funded by insurance funds or local finances,"" Tan said. Moreover, enterprises can be provided with a certain proportion of subsidies for the social insurance premiums of female employees during maternity leave, she said. Tan also suggested giving appropriate bonus points or preferential consideration to companies with better gender equality in government procurement and bidding projects. She recommended strengthening the advocacy of men's parenting responsibilities through the media, urging couples to share family burdens and truly increase women's willingness to bear children. Political adviser Wu Ruijun said childcare services play a crucial role in promoting gender equality in employment and reducing the burden of childcare on families. Wu, a professor from East China Normal University's School of Social Development, said the general cost of childcare services in China is high. According to a 2020 survey from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the average monthly cost for childcare institutions is around 2,700 yuan ($375), accounting for 36 percent of the disposable income of Chinese families that year. Some private childcare institutions have reduced their admission fees after converting to inclusive childcare institutions, but high operating costs such as rent and salaries make it difficult to achieve a revenue balance, Wu said.",9-Apr-24,2024,Daily
Global_2017_03-13,"Murat Saglamoglu holds his baby. Stay-at-home dads might not be a common sight in China, but for Swedish families, where many fathers take parental leave and are seen on the streets pushing strollers, it is parenting as usual. The Consulate General of Sweden in Shanghai will launch a new photography exhibition, Swedish Dads, in order to provoke Chinese parents into giving a second thought to their traditional roles in society. Taken by photographer Johan Bävman, a new father himself, the photos feature several Swedish fathers who chose to stay at home with their child for at least six months after being born. With this project, Bävman aimed to find out why these men opted to put their careers on hold, how their family structures and relationships changed, and their expectations prior to taking leave.In 1974, Sweden became the first country in the world to replace maternity leave with parental leave. With institutional support from the government, both parents became entitled to 480 days of paid leave, including 90 days reserved exclusively for fathers.While on parental leave, Swedish parents can receive an allowance of nearly 80 percent of their salary for 390 days with the remaining 90 days paid at a flat rate.Forty years later, many Swedish fathers feel ""embarrassed"" if they do not take parental leave after having a baby, said Lisette Lindahl, the Consul General of Sweden in Shanghai.Lindahl believes the biggest change the policy has brought to Swedish society is that it has secured women's place in the nation's workforce, allowing more women to pursue a career. It has also reshaped the next generation's view of gender while allowing fathers to better bond with their children.""In Sweden we believe women and men have the same opportunities, rights and obligations in all walks of life,"" said Lindahl. ""We believe whatever men can do women can do as well and vice versa.""To compel more Chinese fathers to become engaged in child rearing, the Consulate General of Sweden in Shanghai will also organize a photography contest featuring Chinese dads with their children, which comes just in time for the current public debate about the vanishing role of fathers in China.In 2015, China amended its Law on Population and Family Planning to allow couples two children. A new parental leave regulation in Shanghai allows women who give birth to their second child to take 128 days maternity leave and has extended paternity leave from three to 10 days.But extended leave still hasn't kept Chinese fathers willingly at home to raise their own kids. China has a long tradition of expecting women to take full responsibility in child rearing. Even with the new second children policy, over 53 percent of women said they are not yet willing to give birth to a second child, according to a report released by All China Women's Federation.Among their biggest concerns are the tremendous efforts to take care of children under three, which inhibits career development. But if more fathers took over such responsibilities, experts believe it will be mutually beneficial to both mothers and children. ""Take the opportunity, stay as much as you can with your children, because it is worth it,"" said Lindahl as a message to Chinese fathers. Selected works from the photography contest will be co-exhibited during the Swedish National Day reception held by the consulate and toured at many public spaces in Shanghai. Participants can submit their work from March 8 to April 30 and follow the consulate's WeChat account for more information.",13-Mar-17,2017,Global
Global_2017_04-11,"The idea of ""gender-neutral parental leave"" is presently being debated across the world, especially in places like the US.Thanks to women like actress Anne Hathaway, the revolution in gender equality is also calling for everybody to enjoy time with their newborn children. Therefore, we start by liberating men from the workplace to be with their children, and by doing this, we also liberate women, the argument goes. It's a form of maternity/paternity leave in equal measure.In the Scandinavian countries of Europe, it has always been the common trend. In countries like Denmark, 90 percent of the men take paid paternity leave to be with their newborn baby or babies.If these progressive countries can do it, why not the rest of the world? Yes, companies pay their employees to be away from their duties for six weeks.I'm the first one to defend a woman's right to do so. Especially after she has carried a baby for nine months, she deserves to be given the opportunity to bond with her child.But these privileges shouldn't belong exclusively to women and married men, but should also be afforded to divorced parents, single parents and fathers who are too busy to spend time with their children.Fathers ought to be able to spend quality time with their children as well. For a dad, to be a part of his son's or daughter's upbringing is precious.If a dad or any parent wants to have time with their child, why not allow equal leave?True, some men might not be interested in it, but they are in a minority. Men have to be given the chance to do the right thing.Therefore, let's start thinking about ""gender-neutral paid parental leave."" I believe it can be given to those parents who want to spend the first 45 days with their newborns.I'd take it one step further. It should also be available to couples who adopt a newborn child, and not just heterosexual couples. It should include couples who are homosexual, lesbian and transgender.A good parent is still a good parent, and they're certainly needed to raise better children for our world. Plus, we have a human responsibility to do the correct thing for all.This article was published on the Global Times Metropolitan section Two Cents page, a space for reader submissions, including opinion, humor and satire.

Global_2018_06-05,"The continuing low fertility rate is a major challenge for China. Only one-third of women in their childbearing age, who have had one child, plan to have a second baby, according to two recent regional surveys conducted by the Center for Population and Development Studies at Renmin University of China. The lack of desire to produce children has been common. An average of 2.1 children born per couple is required to achieve intergenerational replacement level, which is important for stable development of the population. But this is a hard target to reach in China. Removing all policy limits can hardly solve the problem. The economic pressure of childrearing and lack of access to childcare resources are the two major factors that stop families from having a second child. Currently, the birth-friendly family policy is fragmented, decentralized and even absent. The supporting policies are insufficient. Many people wish for larger families but are afraid to go for it. Building a birth-friendly environment can help tackle the issue. First, a government-led and community-based public childcare system for kids under 3 needs to be established. Currently, most families rely on grandparents or nannies to take care of their kids. There are few nurseries to cater to the demand. Couples, especially women, find it difficult to balance work and childcare at the same time. The high cost of childrearing leads to low desire to have babies. Thus, it's urgent to provide infant and toddler care services. Resources have to be mustered to carry out family support projects and build affordable nurseries near residential communities. The nurseries can be run as public-private partnerships for better functioning. If they are administered by the private sector, efficient management techniques should be introduced. Qualified employers should be encouraged to open nurseries and kindergartens with preferential treatment. Enterprises should also be encouraged to cooperate with neighboring communities to provide childcare services for their employees. The employers should also let mothers have some leeway to breastfeed and visit the baby. Second, maternity leave needs to be institutionalized. Surveys found that some employers still have discriminatory policies and give workers shorter maternity leave for the second child than for the first one. Government departments should regulate such behavior and urge enterprises and institutions to implement policies to protect workers' reproductive rights and interests. Research in developed countries shows that parental leave can promote the desire to have children. We can introduce paid and unpaid parental leave. In order to ensure enterprises' high productivity and competitiveness, and reduce losses, public finance should provide subsidies to enterprises. Third, systematic family support policies are necessary to improve welfare of families. In the surveys, more than 70 percent women said that the country's maternity subsidies will motivate them to have larger families. China needs to improve social security policies on child birth, childcare, child development and education. Through maternity subsidies, tax incentives, family allowances and housing guarantees, the financial burden of raising children can be reduced. Fourth, it is essential to incorporate gender equality into family policies. Looking at the connection between fertility and family policy in European countries, low gender equality will reduce the motivation to have babies. Therefore, work-life balance is not just for women but a joint responsibility of both parents. The surveys show more than half of women believe the guarantee not to be dismissed from their jobs due to maternity-related reasons can motivate them to have a second child. In fact, because of the maternity issue, women face discrimination - explicitly or implicitly - in the labor market, and their career is often affected. They struggle to strike a balance between family and work. In addition to special legislation to protect women from discrimination, we should pay attention to husbands' family responsibilities. Paternity leave should be ensured to promote greater involvement in the housework and child care. A flexible maternity leave transfer system can be implemented to allow women to turn over part of their leave to their husbands, and encourage them to take maternity leave.",5-Jun-18,2018,Global
Global_2024_07-12,"A medical staff member cares for a newborn at the neonatal care unit of a hospital in Lianyungang, East China's Jiangsu Province on January 1, 2024. China has established a childbearing and child-rearing supporting system, with a number of policies rolled out in localities across the country, including extending maternity leave to 158 days or longer, raising childbirth allowance and child-rearing subsidies, and providing more professional and affordable babysitter services at childcare institutions, Central China Television reported on Thursday, the 35th World Population Day, citing officials from China's National Health Commission (NHC). A demographer suggested that these policy measures should be further strengthened and added to cope with the fundamental concerns of young people, such as employment stability while more equitable income distribution, should be taken into consideration to boost China's birth rates. Themed under advocating a focus on family education and traditions and cultivation of marriage and child-rearing by the NHC, this year's population day aims to raise public awareness about further addressing China's declining birth rates in recent years and the demographic issues that may affect China's sustainable development. According to the NHC, all provinces have extended maternity leave by 60 days or more, and have set 15 days of paternity leave for families with newborns. In addition, five to 20 days of parental leave are given each year for families with toddlers, with all the provinces having extended their maternity leaves to 158 days or above. Compared with merely extending maternity leave, assuring women's employment after childbirth while offering flexible working hours may have a stronger positive effect, Li Jianmin, a professor of demography with the Institute of Population and Development at Nankai University, told the Global Times on Thursday. In order to alleviate the financial burden of childbearing, child-rearing and education, China established in 2022 the individual income tax special additional deduction for infants nursing for three years, with the deduction standard being 1,000 yuan ($137.53) per month for each child. In 2023, the threshold for special additional income tax deductions for taking care of children under age three was raised from 1,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan each month. Besides, subsidy policies for childbirth and child-rearing have been explored and rolled out in localities across the country. The subsidies offered in Southwest China's Yunnan Province and Northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have covered the entire provincial regions. Yunnan provides a one-time subsidy of 2,000 yuan and 5,000 yuan to families having a second and third child, respectively, along with an annual childcare subsidy of 800 yuan until the child turns three years old. Ningxia offers a one-time subsidy of 2,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan to families having a second and third child, respectively, and a monthly subsidy of no less than 200 yuan to families with a third child until the child reaches three years old. According to Li, rather than introducing the individual income tax special additional deduction which has little impact on low-income families, the root cause of high costs of child-rearing expenses and the problems relating to income distribution must be addressed. Moreover, a unified national policy on subsidies should be introduced since governments in localities at all levels are currently acting according to their own financial capabilities with most subsidies being temporary and not being able to be sustained in the long run, Li said. According to the NHC, a lack of childcare services for infants and toddlers aged up to three years old is one of the major factors holding back childbirth. Last year, the NHC and China's National Development and Reform Commission selected 33 cities as the first batch of demonstration cities for national infant and toddler childcare service, and introduced relevant policies to support and encourage the development of affordable childcare services. One of the 33 demonstration cities, Nanjing in East China's Jiangsu Province has adopted measures such as offering financial subsidies, providing venues, reducing rents and giving tax incentives to encourage social forces to participate in the establishment of an affordable childcare service system. On top of that, Li noted that policies that ensure stable employment and certainty around income will have positive effect on their family planning decisions. China continues to make efforts to improve comprehensive prevention and treatment capabilities for birth defects with the nationwide infant mortality rate and the mortality rate of children under 5 years old due to birth defects both decreasing by over 30 percent compared with five years ago.",12-Jul-24,2024,Global
Xinhua_2019_01-08,"The global population is becoming older due mainly to fewer children being born, reinforced by people living much longer. China is now home to the largest number of elderly people and their size is increasing faster than in most other aging countries, with the fastest increase happening among the oldest old (aged 80 or above). Compared to 115 years for France, it will take just 25 years for China's population aged 60 years or above to double from one in 10 persons in 2000 to one in five persons in 2025. China already has about 240 million people aged 60 or above. These trends have heightened worries about China becoming old before becoming rich especially with the onset of its shrinking labor force in 2011. Can aging also create new opportunities? Are these fears exaggerated? Why would a country that in 40 years has lifted more than 740 million of its people out of poverty and emerged from being among the poorest countries in the world to becoming the second-largest economy be unable to mitigate the adverse consequences of aging? Given that China's elderly population is increasing by 10 million annually, shouldn't the focus be on how to adjust the economy, health systems, and social institutions fast enough to provide economic security, safety and good quality of life for the growing number of senior citizens? And are there new opportunities that come with aging that could further drive economic development? We know that it is the productivity of the population rather than its size that largely determines the economic development of a country. China is already accelerating efforts to massively increase the skill attainment of the population, improve the quality and coverage of affordable healthcare and pension systems, as well as shift the economy toward high-end, innovation-driven manufacturing and services. It may thus be well placed to turn aging into a key driver of sustainable development. Nonetheless, a number of short-term and medium-to-long term actions by the government, the private sector and civil society organizations, especially if well coordinated, would make it easier for the above-painted scenario to be realized in the coming decades. What is to be done? First, actions should be taken to reap the potential of new generations of senior citizens. It is a fact that a typical 70-year old in China today is much healthier and skilled than a 70-year old 20 years ago. So, a gradual increase in the retirement age and equal retirement age for men and women as well as full exploitation of the opportunities from growing the already large ""silver economy"" that caters to the healthcare, learning, mobility, leisure and financial service needs of senior citizens could yield huge longevity dividends. In particular, the expected yearly increase in life expectancy and women's participation in the labor force as the country further modernizes would create room to expand the tax revenue base required for an effective response to aging. Second, measures should be taken to support members of the younger generations who choose to have more children to do so. The fact that young adults in China marry late and choose to have one or no child is the key reason for an aging society, which is also likely to be the case in the foreseeable future because of the high economic and social costs of bearing and raising children especially for women. Women's almost exclusive responsibility for unpaid care work, coupled with inadequate maternity and paternity leave, lack of flexible working arrangements, and work-life imbalance greatly discourage child rearing. Key social measures that might be considered, based on lessons from some Scandinavian countries, include weighted tax reductions, childcare subsidies, affordable quality care for children and the elderly, generous parental leave schemes, institution of flexible work arrangements, and policies to empower women and promote more equal share of household work between men and women. These measures have tended to produce better results when targeted well to reduce inequalities between rural and urban areas, regions and sectors. It would also include provision of access to quality reproductive health services to couples suffering from infertility. Finally, more investment should be made in the younger generations today who will be the older population in the future, particularly in terms of health and education. It is the investment in younger generations that determines active and healthy aging through the life course, and it is the young people that shape future rates of childbearing. Fostering positive responses to aging The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), as the lead UN agency for population and reproductive health, has consistently supported China's improving policy responses to aging from the early 1980s when it funded the country's first major research on aging. It has more recently stepped up support in response to the intensifying speed and scale of aging in China and more than 30 other countries across the world through a Global Programme on Ageing and Low Fertility. As UNFPA celebrates four decades of cooperation with China in 2019, we will continue to work with governments and other institutions to foster more forward-looking, integrated and positive responses to aging. Given China's population and development record to date, we are confident that despite its changing age structure, China's population is likely to remain a strong asset for its sustainable development.

Xinhua_2021_12-28,"The moment they are picked up from kindergarten each day, Tan Xinyan and her schoolmates scamper into a playground with newly installed swings, climbing frames and slides. Even the piercing December cold and early nightfall in Beijing cannot change their daily routine. ""I'm surprised that such a small change can bring the kids so much joy,"" said Tan's mother Hu Yufeng, referring to the new facilities in her residential community. The appearance in old neighborhoods of well-equipped children's playgrounds reflects steps China is taking to create more favorable conditions for child-rearing. The world's most populous country is bracing for the prospect of low fertility rates, which many countries, particularly the advanced economies, are experiencing. The latest census showed that the country's total fertility rate was at a low level of 1.3 in 2020. In 2015, China began to allow all couples to have a second child. In 2021, this was expanded to allowing a third child for each family. It was followed by a slew of supportive measures. The country's population and family planning law was also amended to foster a more birth-friendly society. ""Policy design and law-making at the top aim to address public concerns over the heavy burdens of bearing, raising and educating children,"" said Zhang Guilong, a senior official with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature. At local levels, support on the way includes extended paternity leave, extra parental leave and enhanced public services in terms of tax cuts, housing, employment and education, among other areas. Having grown up as the only child in her family, the 35-year-old mother always envied those who had siblings to play with and offer support. However, she initially hesitated to have a second child, given that her parents and parents-in-law are already in their late 60s, and she and her husband both have busy careers. ""We would be irresponsible parents if we could not offer the children the attention and care they need for a happy and healthy childhood,"" Hu said. As it turns out, her worries about the extra burden of raising two children were unnecessary. ""What doubled is not the workload, but the joy and good memories they created,"" Hu said. With supportive policies being implemented, more mothers-to-be aiming for two or three children are expected to feel the same way. In Beijing, women enjoy 30 days of extra maternity leave, and both parents will have five days of parental leave every year before their child turns three. In northeast China's Liaoning, the paid parental leave for mothers and fathers will amount to 10 days, and new dads will enjoy 20 days of paternity leave. More regions are following suit. ""It is really good news for families like us, where both parents have full-time jobs,"" said Luo Hua, a 38-year-old mother from Yingkou in Liaoning, who is welcoming her third child. The country is also on the move to develop childcare services and improve the affordability and availability of preschool education. Government funding for public childcare services and support to the private sector in developing the services will increase during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025). As for preschool education, the authorities will increase the gross enrolment ratio in kindergartens to more than 90 percent by 2025. The extensive network of health workers at the primary level, particularly in rural areas, has been used to spread prenatal and postnatal knowledge among young couples and offer guidance on child-raising and parenting. On future incentives for couples having children, experts at the Guangdong Academy of Population Development have suggested moves to ensure fair access to education, as well as increasing the supply of quality education resources and offering tax cuts and subsidies to families with more than one child. ""The core of optimizing family planning policy is unleashing child-giving potential at the individual household level,"" said Song Jian, deputy head of the population development studies center at Renmin University of China. ""It requires concerted efforts across society and better social services to alleviate the burden of families in having and raising children."" For Hu Yufeng, the creation of a birth-friendly society requires more changes like new swings and slides. As her daughter Tan is to attend elementary school next September, Hu is expecting birth-friendly policies extending further to her daughter's entire journey to adulthood.

Xinhua_2022_03-17,"Last year, Jiangsu province recorded a negative natural growth rate for the first time since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The birthrate stood at 5.65 births per 1,000 people and the mortality rate at 6.77 deaths per 1,000, resulting in a growth rate of-1.12, according to the Jiangsu Bureau of Statistics. ""The situation is gloomy but things might change over a longer period of time,"" said Yuan Xin, professor of demography at the Population and Development Research Institute at the School of Economics of Nankai University. Despite the birthrate challenge, Jiangsu remains an economic powerhouse. With a population of more than 85 million people, gross domestic product was 11.64 trillion yuan ($1.83 trillion) in 2021, the second-highest regional GDP after Guangdong province. He said he believes Jiangsu's strong economic performance can help address the population problem. ""A downward natural population trend can be offset by inbound immigrants. Given the strong economy and better job prospects, Jiangsu can surely attract more people from other parts of the country to help turn the negative to positive in coming years."" Provinces in Northeast China with weaker economies have shown consistent downward trends in their populations over the past decade, due to an outflow of people. However, the population problem in East China's economically strong Jiangsu has been compounded by the number of newborns declining every year since 2016. The decreasing number of women of childbearing age, postponement of getting married and women studying for a longer time, have all contributed to the decrease in the number of newborns, the Jiangsu Bureau of Statistics said. The number of women aged 20 to 39 decreased by 312,500 from 2000 to 2010, and by 1.47 million over the next decade. In 2021 alone, it fell by more than 110,000. According to the National Health Commission, the number of women aged 20 to 34 in China decreased by 3.4 million annually during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-20). The number dropped by 4.73 million in 2021. Nearly 70 percent of women in Jiangsu who received a college education had just one child. They also accounted for more than half of the women in the province who chose not to have children, the Bureau of Statistics said. By contrast, 59.21 percent of female junior high graduates and 63.42 percent of women with an elementary school education had two or more children. Yuan said that the younger generation no longer considered having children a requirement of family life. ""Their concept of having a family has changed drastically,"" said Yuan. ""The country must face the fact that the birthrate has moved downward and we must get prepared for change. ""The problem is not only related to economics, but also related to many other aspects, including social security, gender equality and childcare. The policymakers of different regions in the country should be aware of the needs of women of childbearing age to put forward effective measures."" According to a newly released Jiangsu government regulation, maternity leave for working mothers has been extended from 98 to 158 days. An additional 15 days of paternity leave has been granted to working fathers during their wife's maternity leave. Each parent can have 10 days of parental leave every year until their child reaches age 3, the regulation says.
