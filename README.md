# gender-equality-policy-supervised-machine-learning
I aim to measure "gender equality" in news coverage of China's parental leave policies. I used my dataset, which includes news articles from 2015 to 2024 from three mainstream news outlets: Global Times, China Daily, and Xinhua News Agency. The dataset consists of the full text of each news article, the date, and the media source. I converted the articles into quasi-sentences and saved all the information as a CSV file.
I applied two random forest (RF) models to this taskâ€”one using bag-of-words vectorization (Model 1) and another using word embedding vectorization (Model 2). Below is a detailed description of the process for each model: 
(1) I created a binary variable to identify whether an article mentions equal-sharing of care responsibilities between men and women. (2) I simulated supervised learning classification by manually coding a stratified sample of the text data from the three news outlets. (3) I tokenized the sample text data using the bag-of-words method, treating similar and dissimilar words as unique tokens. (4) I split the data into training, validation, and test sets. (5) I used the training data to build the RF model through the RandomForestClassifier function. (6) I tuned and evaluated the model using the validation set according to the best set of parameters. (7) I evaluated the model's true out-of-sample performance using the test set. (8) Finally, I applied the model to the full dataset.
